# Lawnbot Discarded Estimate Feature


## Setup Instructions

To start application please cd into the lawnbot directory and run ```npm install``` and ```npm run start``` to start server.'

## Libraries

The application is built using the react-canvas-draw API.

## Dependencies 
- "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.11.5",
- "@testing-library/react": "^11.1.0",
- "@testing-library/user-event": "^12.1.10",
- "eslint-plugin-react-hooks": "^4.2.0",
- "react": "^17.0.1",
- "react-dom": "^17.0.1",
- "react-scripts": "4.0.0",
- "web-vitals": "^0.2.4"

## Goals and Limitations

- This project focuses on creating a specific feature that saves discarded previous estimates on a side bar in case a user wants to go back to a previous take of a drawing.

- The application is not meant to be used in a comprehensive manner to deliver estimates as that API is already built. The project features no maps or estimate API's and instead uses an image of a single property, as well as randomly generated estimates, in order to encapsulate the UX of the Measur.it tool.
